1.Responsive Websit =>
    Responsive website are the sites who adjust itself on different devices.
    in mobile screen it will shrink itself and look good
    and in laptop screen it adjust itself as screen size
2. em vs px =>
    when we use px value in css it does not support the browser instead of px if we use em then browser supports changes.
    When uer changes the font setting in browser , px unit in HTML/CSS will not support those changes.
    But instead of px ,when em is used then it does support the changes made in brower settings.


    The px unit in HTML/CSS will not accept changes made by the user when the font setting is changed in the browser.
    However, when em is used in place of px, the browser settings can be supported.

3.px is not scalable in browser but % and em are scalable
if we set the font size in % or em it is relative to the font size of their parent element.
if we set font size in rem then the font size is relative to their root element
